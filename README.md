# Native Shell Improved
This is a fork of Native Shell with corrected backspace behaviour and the ability to display Windows version information.

# Building
WinDDK and NTNDK (https://code.google.com/p/native-nt-toolkit/) is required. Only tested with Windows 7 DDK.

From a WinDDK developer command line shell, run `b.cmd`.
